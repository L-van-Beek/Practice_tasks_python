# Ah, the four seasons in the year — winter, spring, summer, or fall; all you have to do is call!

# Ask the user the month number using the input() function.

# Check for the four seasons using an if/elif/else statement and logical operators:

    # month is 1, 2, 3, print 'Winter 🌨️'
    # month is 4, 5, 6, print 'Spring 🌱'
    # month is 7, 8, 9, print 'Summer 🌻'
    # month is 10, 11, 12, print 'Autumn 🍂'
    # Everything else is 'Invalid'

# Logical operators in Python include the and and or keywords. Which one should you use? 

# Code: 

print("-----------")
print("Let's play a guessing game: tell me the number of a current month \n And I will tell you what season we are in")
print("-----------")
month = int(input("Type the number of the month: "))
if month == 1 or month == 2 or month == 3:
  print("Winter 🌨️")
elif month == 4 or month == 5 or month == 6:
  print("Spring 🌱")
elif month == 7 or month == 8 or month == 9:
  print("Summer 🌻")
elif month == 10 or month == 11 or month == 12:
  print("Autumn 🍂")
else:
  print("Invalid")
