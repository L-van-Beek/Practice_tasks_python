# Create a program that uses a for loop and range() function to display the following pattern in the terminal using a bunch of asterisks *:

# *
# * *
# * * *
# * * * *
# * * * * *
# ... and so on

# It should look like this but with 25 rows total.

# Solution: 
for astericks in range(1, 25):
  print(astericks * "*")
